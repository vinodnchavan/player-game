# Player Game Project 🎮

This is a Python-based mini project built for a coding assessment. The main goal was to create a `Player` class that simulates a player’s actions, attributes, and interactions inside a game world.

This assignment helped me brush up on object-oriented programming and implement logic in a more game-development-friendly and readable manner. I also tried to style the code to reflect both VFX/game logic and practical use cases.

## 📌 Features

- Custom `Player` class with:
  - Health, level, and attack/defense stats
  - Inventory (items collected)
  - Methods to take damage, heal, and level up
- Stat and state management logic
- Clean console output showing before and after state

---

## 🧠 What I Learned / Focused On

- Clean Python structure with method definitions
- Intermediate-level class design
- Applying boundaries to health (not below 0, not above max)
- Improving readability through meaningful variable and method names
- Added VFX-relevant item names to relate it to the studio domain

## 🛠️ Tech & Tools Used

- Python 3.11+
- Terminal for testing (`python DD_Player_game_Project.py`)
- Git for version control
- VS Code for development and linting
